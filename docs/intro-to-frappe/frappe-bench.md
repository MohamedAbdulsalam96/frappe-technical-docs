# Frappe Bench

Frappe Bench, often referred to as just "Bench," is a command-line tool (CLI) and utility provided by the Frappe framework for managing multiple Frappe applications and instances on a single server. It serves as an essential tool for setting up, configuring, and maintaining Frappe-based applications and is commonly used in development, testing, and production environments. Key features and functions of Frappe Bench include:

## Installation and Updates

You can use Bench to install and update Frappe and ERPNext (an open-source ERP system built on Frappe). Bench simplifies the process of keeping your applications and the Frappe framework itself up to date.

## Development Environment

Bench is commonly used as part of the development environment for building Frappe applications. Developers can create, test, and customize applications on their local machines and then deploy them to production servers using Bench.

## Site Setup and Configuration

Bench provides commands for setting up new sites, configuring database connections, defining site-specific settings, and managing site backups.

## Site Management

Within each Frappe application, Bench can create and manage individual sites. A site represents a specific instance of a Frappe application with its own database and configuration. Sites are useful for hosting multiple independent applications on the same server.

## Application Management

Bench allows you to create, install, and manage multiple Frappe applications on a single server. Each application can have its own configuration, database, and set of installed apps.

## Database Management

Bench offers commands for database management, including database backups, restores, and migrations.

## Logging and Monitoring

You can use Bench to view application and server logs, which is essential for debugging and monitoring the health of your applications.

## Security and Permissions

Bench provides role-based access control (RBAC) and user management features to control access to the different components of your Frappe applications and instances.

## Multi-tenancy

Bench supports multi-tenancy, allowing you to host multiple sites (instances) of the same application on a single server, each with its own database and configuration.

## Customization and Extensibility

Bench can be extended with custom apps and commands, making it flexible for various deployment and management scenarios.

## Production Deployment

Bench offers deployment commands to set up Frappe applications in production environments, including configuring web servers (e.g., Nginx, Gunicorn), SSL certificates, and more.
