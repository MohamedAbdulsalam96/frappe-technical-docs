# What is Frappe?

Frappe is an open-source web application framework written in **Python** and based on the Flask micro web framework. It is designed to make it easier to build and customize web applications and is particularly well-suited for developing enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, customer relationship management (CRM) software, and other business applications.

Here are some key features and components of the Frappe framework:

- **ORM** (Object-Relational Mapping): Frappe provides an ORM that allows developers to interact with the database using Python objects, making database operations more intuitive and Pythonic.

- **Document Management**: Frappe uses a document-based data model, which means that data is stored in documents with predefined fields and relationships between them. This is especially useful for modeling business processes.

- **REST API**: Frappe includes a built-in RESTful API, making it easy to expose your application's functionality to external systems and clients.

- **User Authentication and Permissions**: Frappe offers user authentication and role-based permissions out of the box, allowing you to control access to various parts of your application.

- **Customization**: Frappe is highly customizable. You can create custom doctypes (document types), customize existing ones, and define workflows to automate business processes.

- **Scripting**: Frappe uses Python for server-side scripting, making it accessible to a wide range of developers. You can write server-side scripts to add business logic to your application.

- **UI Framework**: Frappe includes a front-end UI framework based on Bootstrap, which can be used to create responsive and user-friendly interfaces.

- **Notifications and Email Integration**: You can set up email notifications and integrate email with your application using Frappe.

- **Background Jobs**: Frappe includes a task queue system for handling background jobs, which can help improve the performance and scalability of your application.

- **Community and Extensions**: Frappe has an active community of developers and users, and there are many extensions and applications built on top of the framework that can be easily integrated into your projects.

Frappe is best known for being the foundation of the ERPNext application, which is a popular open-source ERP system built using the Frappe framework. However, you can use Frappe to build a wide range of web applications beyond ERP systems. It simplifies the development process by providing a set of common features and tools that are often needed when building business applications.
