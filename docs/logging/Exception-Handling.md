# Exception Handling
In Frappe, throwing an exception is similar to throwing an exception in other programming languages. An exception is a type of object that is used to indicate that something unusual has occurred in your code. When an exception is thrown, it can either be caught and handled in your code by an exception handler, or it can propagate up the call stack until it is caught by a higher-level exception handler.

The frappe.throw() function can be used to throw an exception in Frappe. The first argument to this function is an error message, and the second argument is an optional error code. As an example:

    frappe.throw(“An error occurred while processing the request”)

# Specific Exception Handling
You can also specify the type of exception you want to throw by passing the class of the exception to the frappe.throws() function. For example:

    frappe.throw(frappe.ValidationError, “Invalid input”)

To catch and handle an exception in Frappe, you can use a try-except block. This block allows you to specify code that should be executed when an exception is thrown and code that should be executed if no exception is thrown. For example:

    try:

    # code that may throw an exception

    except frappe.ValidationError:

    # code to handle the ValidationError exception

    except Exception:

    # code to handle any other exception
