# Logging in Frappe

In Frappe, logging is a way to record and keep track of what's happening within your application. It's similar to keeping a journal or diary of events that occur while your application runs. Logging in Frappe is used to capture various types of information, warnings, errors, and other details to help developers and administrators understand what's happening in the system.

## Log Levels

In Frappe, logs are categorized into different levels based on their severity and importance. The common log levels are:

- **DEBUG:** Used for detailed debugging information. These logs are typically used by developers during application development and debugging.

- **INFO:** General information about the application's operation. It can include things like when a user logs in or when a document is created.

- **WARNING:** Indicates potential issues that are not critical but need attention. For example, a warning might be logged if an operation took longer than expected.

- **ERROR:** Represents critical errors or issues that require immediate attention. When something goes wrong in the application, an error log is generated.

## Logging Methods

In Frappe, you can use logging methods to record information. These methods are usually available in Python scripts and server-side code. The main logging methods include `frappe.logger.debug()`, `frappe.logger.info()`, `frappe.logger.warning()`, and `frappe.logger.error()`.

## Log Files

The log messages generated by your application are typically stored in log files. These log files can be configured to rotate or archive over time to prevent them from becoming too large.

## Log Analysis

Log files are valuable for diagnosing issues in your Frappe application. Developers and system administrators can review these logs to understand what happened leading up to a problem or to monitor the application's performance and usage.

## Custom Logging

You can also implement custom logging in your Frappe application by adding log statements in your code. This allows you to record specific events or data relevant to your application's requirements.

In summary, logging in Frappe is a way to keep a record of what's happening in your application. It's essential for troubleshooting issues, monitoring performance, and ensuring the smooth operation of your Frappe-based software. Developers and administrators use logs to gain insights into the behavior of the application and to detect and resolve problems quickly.
